            <p class="text-justify">
                Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors, calculated as the cosine of the angle between the vectors in high-dimensional space. The vectors in this context are the embeddings of topics from research and policy documents, respectively. These embeddings were calculated using the BERTopic model. A cosine similarity score of 0 means the vectors are orthogonal (no similarity) and a score of 1 indicates the vectors are in the same direction (perfect similarity).

                    This heatmap visualizes the cosine similarity scores between scientific research and policy topics related to conservation. Each cell represents the similarity score between a research topic (rows) and a policy topic (columns), with higher scores (closer to 1) indicating stronger alignment. The darker red cells indicate strong alignment between research and policy topics. Blue cells indicate weak or no alignment, suggesting gaps between research and policy on certain topics.

Red nodes are policy topics and blue nodes are scientific research topics. Clustering of nodes indicates similarity, and as such tighter clusters indicate greater similarity between topics.

                This bar chart shows the novelty scores calculated for each topic, which were calculated as 1 - cosine similarity between past and recent embeddings for the same topic, where past is defined as earlier than 2022. Higher scores indicate topics that show more significant changes over time, suggesting there have been shifts in research focus or evolving policy changes. As such, lower scores indicate topics that remain stable between the recent past and present, suggesting more stagnation in that area.

                    This bar chart shows the highest cosine similarity score for each research topic. Each research topic has a corresponding policy topic. These corresponding topics were found by calculating the average embedding of all documents assigned to a topic and then taking the cosine similarity between the average embedding of each research topic and policy topic. This results in a similarly score for every possible pair of research and policy topics. A higher score then indicates that the research and policy topics are closely aligned in content and thus a lower score indicates lack of overlap. When looking at the bars, the taller the bar, the stronger the alignment.

                These visuals work together to illustrate the findings of applying the BERTopic model to abstracts gathered on documents relating to wildlife conservation in both scientific and policy genres, and then calculating the cosine similarity to identify whether there is overlap between topics.

Upon first glance, the heatmap shows that there is generally little alignment between topics, with a few red elements showing where the alignment is greater between topics in scientific research and policy. However, when looking at the topics that are said to align in the alignment bar chart, some nonsensical results appear. For example, scientific research topic 17 has the corresponding topic of 59 in policy, and upon inspection these topics are “Topic 17: jats sc, sc, sequencing, rad, genotyping” and “Topic 59: cooperative, cooperatives, operatives, societies, members”, respectively. Yet, topics like 156 in research corresponds to 73 in policy, which are “Topic 156: tree, productivity, diversity, complementarity, tree growth” and “Topic 73: model, animals, animal, entry union, consignments”, respectively. While this latter example appears slightly closer in connection than the first, both are said to have high values for cosine similarity. Therefore, further data processing is needed to understand where this discrepancy is coming from. Overall, these visuals provide an excellent launch point for developing a deeper understanding of the alignment between scientific research goals and policy objectives over the last decade, and have the potential with improved data processing to assess whether current policy addresses pressing conservation or ecological needs.
