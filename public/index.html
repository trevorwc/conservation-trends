                The biodiversity crisis is one of the defining issues of our generation. 
            </strong></p>
            <p>
                An exploding global population, spread of invasive species, pollution of the environment and, above all, loss of natural ecosystems <br> 
                has led to a loss of life on Earth that is unprecedented in its origins: <b><i> humanity.</i></b>
            </p>

        <div class="row justify-content-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                Humanity has long been a factor in the extinction of other species, 
                including iconic megafauna like the mammoth, but industrialization and global spread 
                has led to catastrophic loss. 
                The impact of humanity on other species has been staggering- with the period since 1955 representing
                <a href = "https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/sustainability-indicators/biodiversity-factsheet#:~:text=In%20Earth's%20history%2C%20there%20have,2%20million%20years%20or%20less.&text=Globally%2C%20the%20relative%20abundance%20of,average%20of%2069%25%20since%201970.">
                      the greatest biodiversity loss in human history.
                </a> 
                Extinction rates are 100 to 1,000x higher than rates before humanity.
                Evidence from monitored populations suggests a decrease in relative abundance of 69% since 1970, 
                especially in freshwater species. 
                Even insects, seemingly ubiquitous, have seen their populations 
                <a href = "https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2023989118">decrease by 45%.</a>
                In fact, the biodiversity crisis has become so severe that it has popularly been referred to as the Sixth Mass Extinction,
                a moniker which reflects the fact that continued loss of life at current rates
                could put us on a path toward destruction akin to the previous Big Five Extinctions.
            </p>
            <p>
                And yet our current crisis is fundamentally unlike the Big Five Extinctions is that there 
                is no astroid or volcanic activity at its center. Instead, our decisions will determine 
                the future of this crisis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is widely understood that science and policy will need to work together if 
                this crisis is to be solved. But both science and policy can be notoriously slow to change,
                and the vast differences between these two fields can lead to difficulties in communication.
                Despite the intensification of the biodiversity crisis over the past decade, advances in science,
                policy, and the interplay between the two remain unclear.

            <p>
                In order to answer these questions, we leverage recent advances in natural language processing and data assimilation.
                We analyze trends in the topics, innovation, and accessibility of conservation science over the past decade. 
                Additionally, we look at the most popular topics in conservation policy. 
                Finally, we compare trends in science and conservation to highlight potential areas for alignment.

                This website, highlighting our methodology and conclusions, is organized into three sections:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Trends in Science, </strong> where we analyze 13,661 scientific abstracts published in journals 
                between 2013 and October of 2024 which were uploaded to Crossref, the largest DOI agency in the world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Trends in Policy, </strong> where we analyze the topics in conservation policy as accessed through Ecolex, a database for environmental legislation globally.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Comparison, </strong> where we offer insights into similarities and differences between what our results
                show the priorities of science and policy.
