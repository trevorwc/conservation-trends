                Science has been essential for our understanding of the current extent of the biodiversity crisis,
                and it will be essential if we are to halt the destruction. 
                Clearly, <strong>innovative solutions are needed for a problem with such diffuse and varied causes. </strong>
                Unique research methods have the potential to come to innovative and impactful conclusions,
                making innovative science investigating pressing topics a key priority for conservation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The field of conservation science has itself become increasingly diverse. 
                In addition to the canonical conservationists collecting samples in remote landscapes,
                advances in cellular biology as well as computational
                power and techniques means that scientists have an increasing number of tools at their disposal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, we <strong> analyzed trends in the topics of scientific papers published between 2013 and 2024.</strong>
                In order to do this, we used the BERTopic model which weights both term frequenccy and inverse document frequency, 
                capturing both important words that are used often throughout the document and important words that are used rarely.
                We used the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' embedding model acecssed through Python's sentence_transformer package and scikit-learn's 
                CountVectorizer model. The model outputs the predicted topic of each abstract, as well as the probability that the 
                article belongs to the classified topic. The topics themselves consist of four key words/ phrases which can provide insight
                into the specific aspect of a larger topic that a study is investigatig.
            </p>
            <p>
                We assessed yearly trends the topics of scientific papers through an analysis of their abstracts. <strong>We accessed 81,958
                 journal abstracts related to the keyword "conservation" since 2013 through the Crossref API </strong> accessed through
                 Python's habanero package. We then filtered to those that were 
                published in 85 "disciplinary journals," which we defined as those with more than 100 articles related to conservation,
                leaving us with 68,065 abstracts. This was based on the assumption that those with innovative work would
                choose to publish it in a discipline-specific journal or high-impact broad readership journal that 
                often publishes on the subject. We <strong>classified each abstract into 667 topics </strong>, which were discovered by the 
                BERTopic model from the unlabeled abstracts. Nearly half of the abstracts fit
                the "intercept" term that can be thought of as unclassified or too difficult to classify and were not included in this analysis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to ensure that we were only accessing the highest quality data, we <strong>only performed subsequent 
                analysis on those topics that had more than 100 articles, then filtered to those with more than 50% probability </strong>
                of being in their assigned class. This left us with <strong>13,661 abstracts </strong> remaining. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the primary questions we had was <strong> What are the most studied topics in conservation science?</strong>
                The top 10 topics, defined by total articles published 
                on that topic from 2013-2024, can be visualized in the histogram below.

            <p>
                Some viewers might notice that there are actually 11 topics plotted- this is because 
                the gut microbiome and sperm are both tied for 10th place in terms of total count. 
                Some notable trends stick out, including the <strong> increase in reserach about fires, agricultural yields, 
                and pollinators. </strong> Some of the topics in this list of the most popular are likely familiar to those
                that follow the zietgeist of popular science, while others reflect long-running disciplinary interests. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But what about the rest of the topics? 
                We visualized the <strong> yearly trends of all 80 topics </strong> in the following interactive line chart. 
            </p>

                This analysis is able to show how the popularity of different topics
                has changed in absolute terms, but we were interested in exploring 
                <strong>
                    which topics have seen the largest relative increases and decreases in popularity?
                </strong> 
                This metric can give a better idea of which 
                topics have become relatively more or less popular, versus those that have long been mainstream.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relative change in each topic's popularity in 2021-2023 compared to its average from 2013-2015 is plotted
                below in an interactive bar chart that allows users to compare as many of few topics as are of interest.
                Topics that experienced very large increases or decreases were truncated to 10x in order to aid visualization.

            <p>
                We see that the five topics that have seemingly fallen out of favor are related to working conditions,
                demography, queens/workers, health care, and the genetics of salmon and trout. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Interstingly, these "out of favor" topics may point to a limitation of the model's ability to
                understand the meaning of words given context, or could represent overly narrow categories. 
                For example, the meaning of queens, workers, and colony most
                likely relate to pollinators, but these articles were not included in the pollinators category. 
                It is plausible that this research represents a distinct subject, but without additional
                manual analysis, the model is unable to differntiate these possibilities.

        <div class="row justify-content-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                In addition to identifying the key topics and their changes over time, we wondered: <strong>has science become more or less innovative
                over the past decade? </strong> There are many ways that innovation 
                can be measured, but in this application we were specifically interested 
                in exploring the potential for natural language processing to be used to measure innovation. 
                This was partially due to the fact that other methods,
                such as analyzing trends in citations, would not be possible as this is not included in this dataset. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to do this, <strong> we used the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer available through the vaderSentiment package. </strong>
                This approach quantifies the sentiment of a piece of text by assigning relative polarity to words, accounting 
                for their meaning in context, and being able to handle different valences within the same document. 
                As we were interested in the relative innovation of a paper rather than its positive vs. negative polarity, 
                <strong>we created a custom lexicon of words that indicate innovation </strong> (e.g. propose, discover, breakthrough) and words 
                that indicate stagnation (e.g. modest, marginal, replicated). We assigned all innovative words a weight of 1,
                and all stagnation words a weight of -1. Future work should prioritize a rigorous weighting of these words 
                based on their relative innovation/ stagnation, as has been developed for sentiment polarity. However,
                no such resource currently exists for innovation/ novelty scores. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <!--Plot of subject-level innovation over time-->
            <p>
                As is shown in the above chart, the past decade has seen a statistically significant increase in average innovation (p = 0.039). 
            </p>
            <p>
                But a more fundamental philosophical question remains: how important is innovative science if it remains in narrowly read journals?
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientific journals are often derided as the pinnacle of ivory tower insularity, partially
                because the modes of communication employed within their pages is jargon-laden, idiosyncratic, and difficult
                for a general audience to follow. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, making science digestible to those outside of a specific field would seem to be an 
                important first step for translating research into policy and action by stakeholders. 
                We ask: <strong> has conservation science become more or less accessible?</strong>
                In order to understand whether conservation science has become more or less accessible, for each 
                abstract we computed the Flesch-Kincaid grade level- which translates readibility score to 
                the US grade system. For example, something that recieves a 14 would be considered 
                at the level of a college sophomore. The score is calculated as:
            </p>
            <p>
                score = 0.39*(total words / total sentences) + 11.8*(total syllables / total words) - 15.59
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <!-- Plot of readability over time -->
            <canvas id="fkgChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
            <script src="script.js"></script>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                These results demonstrate a <strong> statistically significant decrease in average Flesch-Kincaid grade </strong> (p = 0.003), 
                which indicates increasing readability. In fact, from the highest average grade level of 15.3 in 2016 to the 
                lowest of 14.3, we see scientists modifying their language to the extent that the reading level is reduced 
                by an entire year of higher education. A few limitations of this grade level approach relevant to science, should be noted,
                specifically that this index is based upon word and sentence structure, and therefore cannot account for 
                phenomena like jargon. Accounting for the vast corpus of jargon across all conservation disciplines is out of scope of this 
                analysis, but remains a topic ripe for future work. 
            </p>

                Overall, these results show increasing interest in water and air pollution, ecology, energy, and agriculture.
                We also find that conservation <strong>science has become more innovative over the past decade. </strong>
                At the same time, <strong>the language employed by scientists has become more more accessible. </strong>
                Taken together, these results would suggest a <strong>significant opportunity for policy innovation </strong> in the topics that
                researchers have determined to be the most important and pressing. The next portion of this project
                looks at the most popular topics in conservation policy to determine the extent to which the 
                priorities of scientists and policy makers align.
