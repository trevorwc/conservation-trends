            <p>
                The field of conservation science has itself become increasingly diverse. 
                In addition to the canonical conservationists collecting samples in remote landscapes,
                advances in cellular biology as well as computational
                power and techniques means that scientists have an increasing number of tools at their disposal.
            </p>
            <p>
                We assessed yearly trends the topics of scientific papers through an analysis of their abstracts. After
                accessing 81,958 journal abstracts related to the keyword "conservation" since 2013, we filtered to those
                published in 85 "disciplinary journals," which we defined as those with more than 100 articles related to conservation,
                leaving us with 68,065 abstracts. The model classified the abstracts into 667 topics. Nearly half of the abstracts fit
                the "intercept" term that can be thought of as unclassified or too difficult to classify. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to ensure that we were only accessing the highest quality data, we only performed subsequent 
                analysis on those topics that had more than 100 articles, then filtered to those with more than 50% probability 
                of being in their assigned class. This left us with 13,661 abstracts remaining. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The top 10 topics can be visualized in the histogram below. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Some viewers might notice that there are actually 11 topics plotted- this is because 
                the gut microbiome and sperm are both tied for 10th place in terms of total count. 
                Some notable trends stick out, including the increase in reserach about fires, agricultural yields, 
                and pollinators. Some of the topics in this list of the most popular are likely familiar to those
                that follow the zietgeist of popular science, while others reflect long-running disciplinary interests. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But what about the rest of the topics? 
                We visualized the yearly trends of all 80 topics in the following interactive line chart. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Interactive Dropdown and Line Chart Section -->
        <div class="container mt-5">
            <label for="labelSelect" class="form-label"> Select a topic:</label>
            <select id="labelSelect" class="form-control mb-3">
                <option value="">Select</option>
            </select>
            <canvas id="lineChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
        </div>
        <div class="row justify-content-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                The previous charts give a good understanding of trends in science in absolute terms, but which
                topics have changed the most in relative terms? This metric can give a better idea of which 
                topics have become relatively more or less popular, versus those that have long been mainstream.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relative change in each topic's popularity compared to its average from 2013-2015 is plotted
                below in an interactive bar chart that allows users to compare as many of few topics as are of interest.
                
            </p>
        </div>
        <canvas id="relativeChangeChart"></canvas>
        <div id="multiLabelDropdownContainer", style = "max-height: 200px; max-width: 800px; overflow-y: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;  padding: 5px;">
            <label for="searchInput">Search Labels:</label>
              <input type="text" id="searchInput" placeholder="Type to search...">
            <div id="multiLabelDropdown"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row justify-content-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                We see that the five topics that have seemingly fallen out of favor are related to working conditions,
                demography, queens/workers, health care, and the genetics of salmon and trout. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Interstingly, these "out of favor" topics may point to a limitation of the model's ability to
                understand the meaning of words given context, or could represent overly narrow categories. 
                For example, the meaning of queens, workers, and colony most
                likely relate to pollinators, but these articles were not included in the pollinators category. 
                It is plausible that this research represents a distinct subject, but without additional
                manual analysis, the model is unable to differntiate these possibilities. 
            </p>

        <div class="text-center">
            <p class="lead mb-4"> Innovation in science </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row justify-content-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                In addition to identifying the key topics and their changes over time, a key question is whether 
                there has been any trend in innovation in conservation science. There are many ways that innovation 
                can be measured, but we were specifically interested in how natural language processing can be used 
                to measure innovation from the abstract. This was partially due to the fact that other methods,
                such as analyzing trends in citations, would not be possible as this is not included in this dataset. 
            </p>
            <!--Plot of innovation over time-->
            <canvas id="innoChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
            <script src="script.js"></script>
            <!--Plot of subject-level innovation over time-->
            <p>
                In additon to the "innovation" sentiment analysis, we explored semantic complexity as a measure 
                of scientific complexity. This is undoubtedly an imperfect measure- as one mark of a good scientist 
                is finding simplicity in complexity- but is based on the reasoning that more complex language will be 
                necessary to write about more complex topics. 
            </p>
            <!-- Plot of readability over time -->
            <canvas id="fkgChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
            <script src="script.js"></script>
            <p>
                These two metrics provide seemingly contradictory results. In order to test the hypothesis
                that more innovative scientists may simply be using simpler language, we tested 
                regressed innovation against grade. The two were significantly positively related, indicating 
                that more innovative studies tended to use more complex language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because our two different methods found different results regarding the change in innovation,
                we are unable to come to difinitive conclusions at this time. It is possible that approaches
                outside of NLP, such as citation analysis, might be necessary.
