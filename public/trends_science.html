            <p>
                The field of conservation science has itself become increasingly diverse. 
                In addition to the canonical conservationists collecting samples in remote landscapes,
                advances in cellular biology as well as computational
                power and techniques means that scientists have an increasing number of tools at their disposal.
            </p>
            <p>
                We assessed yearly trends the topics of scientific papers through an analysis of their abstracts. After
                accessing 81,958 journal abstracts related to the keyword "conservation" since 2013, we filtered to those
                published in 85 "disciplinary journals," which we defined as those with more than 100 articles related to conservation,
                leaving us with 68,065 abstracts. The model classified the abstracts into 667 topics. Nearly half of the abstracts fit
                the "intercept" term that can be thought of as unclassified or too difficult to classify. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to ensure that we were only accessing the highest quality data, we only performed subsequent 
                analysis on those topics that had more than 100 articles, then filtered to those with more than 50% probability 
                of being in their assigned class. This left us with 13,661 abstracts remaining. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The top 10 topics can be visualized in the histogram below. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some notable trends stick out, including the increase in reserach about fires, agricultural yields, 
                and pollinators. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Top 10 Popular Topics Bar Chart container -->
        <div class="container">

        <div class="row justify-content-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                Still, the large differences in total count between different topics can obscure trends, so 
                it might be more informative to look at a single topic over time. We visualized those trends 
                in the following interactive line chart. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To look at the trend in a specific topic over time, select a topic below. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Interactive Dropdown and Line Chart Section -->
        <div class="container mt-5">
            <label for="labelSelect" class="form-label"> Select a topic:</label>
            <select id="labelSelect" class="form-control mb-3">
                <option value="">Select</option>
            </select>
            <canvas id="lineChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
        </div>
        <div class="row justify-content-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                We were also interested in seeing which topics have become relative more or less popular throughout the years.
                Therefore, we calculated the relative change in the number of articles published on a toppic relative to the
                average of the first three years of the dataset.
            </p>
            <p>In order to allow for easy visual comparison, topics that have increased or decreased by more than 10x 
                have been truncated. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <canvas id="relativeChangeChart"></canvas>
        <div id="multiLabelDropdownContainer", style = "max-height: 200px; max-width: 800px; overflow-y: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;  padding: 5px;">
            <label for="searchInput">Search Labels:</label>
              <input type="text" id="searchInput" placeholder="Type to search...">
            <div id="multiLabelDropdown"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row justify-content-start" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                We see that the five topics that have seemingly fallen out of favor are related to working conditions,
                demography, queens/workers, health care, and the genetics of salmon and trout. 
                This points to a potenital limitation of the model, as the meaning of queens, workers, and colony most
                likely relate to pollinators, but these articles were not included in the pollinators category.
