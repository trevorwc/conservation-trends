The FMP covers fisheries for all stocks of finfish except salmon, steelhead, Pacific halibut, Pacific herring, and tuna. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council is one of eight regional councils established by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1976 to manage fisheries in the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone. The Magnuson-Stevens Act contains ten national standards, with which all FMPs must conform and which guide fishery management. FMPs must also be consistent with the requirements of other legislation such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Climate change-induced effects are taken into account in fishery management measures. Pursuant to Title II of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, there is currently no allowable level of foreign fishing for the groundfish fisheries covered by this FMP.""]"

The acknowledgement of the role of cooperatives in contributing to the regional, international and national development agendas, as well as promoting inclusive, sustainable development and economic transformation is the driving force behind the formulation of this policy. The overriding objective of the policy is to enable the cooperative movement play its vital role towards the transformation of the national economy. The specific objectives of the policy includes to (a) revisit the structure of the Rwanda Cooperative Agency to respond to new dynamics in the various sectors of the cooperative development; (b) Redefine the organizational structure of cooperative movement; (c) Improve the current management and accountability system in the overall structure of cooperative movement; (d) Improve the government and cooperative policy dialogue to enhance cooperative’s contribution in the national development; among others.

The plan noted challenges pertaining to the institutional and policy framework of cooperatives like issues with streamlining of the process of formation and registration of cooperatives, issues of categorization of cooperatives, lack of policy guidance for cooperatives with high investment potentials, insufficient policy oversight on internal accountability mechanisms, etc. At the time of the formulation of the policy, there were 8406 registered cooperatives, a significant bump from the 919 as at 2005, prior to the first cooperative policy; worthy to note that the analysis shows that the agricultural sector has more membership than any other cooperative sector. The Policy is to be implemented through the role of government and stakeholders including the Central Government, Ministry of Trade and Industry, key Government Agencies, the National Bank of Rwanda, the Districts, cooperative unions etc. Essentially, this is a policy review brought about by the need to adapt cooperative organizations that have hitherto been operating within the old legal framework and outdated policy.

Chapter 9 terminate the Act with final provisions.', 'These Regulations make provision under section 27(5) of the Climate Change Act 2008 (c. 27) (“the Act”). Regulation 3 requires the Secretary of State to determine whether the UK’s emissions allowance under international emissions reduction targets are higher than the UK’s emissions allowance under domestic carbon budgets. Where the assigned amount is greater, regulation 3 requires the Secretary of State to calculate the number of UK assigned amount units representing the excess. Regulation 3 also sets out what the Secretary of State must take into account when calculating this and requires that UK assigned amount units in excess are not used to offset greenhouse gas emissions in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. These Regulations make provision under Section 27(5) of the Climate Change Act 2008 (“the Act”), which requires the Secretary of State to determine whether the UK’s emissions allowance under international emissions reduction targets are higher than the UK’s emissions allowance under domestic carbon budgets. Any excess units representing the difference in stringency between the domestic carbon budget and international targets are to be made unavailable to prevent the UK from using excess emissions allowances to offset greenhouse gas emissions in the UK or elsewhere. The relevant international agreement for these Regulations is the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol which makes provision for the Second Commitment Period (2013- 2020) (“the Second Commitment Period”). The corresponding period under domestic emission reduction targets made under the Act is Carbon Budget 2 (2013-2017) and the first three years of Carbon Budget 3 (2018-2020).', 'In this Regulation, “aggregate facility” means a group of 2 or more conventional oil and gas facilities designated as an aggregate facility by the director under section 5; “allowable emissions” means the allowable emissions (i) for a large emitter or opted-in facility, as determined in accordance with section 9, or (ii) for an aggregate facility, as determined in accordance with section 10; “annual forecasting report” means a report under section 16; “benchmark” means the emissions intensity assigned for a product for allocation purposes; “benchmark unit” means the unit of measure of a product for a benchmark; “biomass CO2 emissions” means all emissions of carbon dioxide released from sources located at a facility as a result of the decomposition, fermentation or combustion of biomass;  “CO2e tonnes” in respect of a specified gas means the carbon dioxide equivalent tonnes determined in accordance with subsection; “direct emissions” means the quantity of all specified gases released from sources located at a facility, expressed in CO2e tonnes, not including biomass CO2 emissions; and “opted-in facility” means a facility designated as an opted-in facility under section 4. For the purposes of this Regulation, a quantity of a specified gas, expressed in tonnes, is converted into carbon dioxide equivalent tonnes by multiplying that quantity by the global warming potential set out for the specified gas in the Standard for Completing Greenhouse Gas Compliance and Forecasting Reports. Pursuant to section 61 of the Act, the following standards published by the department, as amended or replaced from time to time, are incorporated into and form part of this Regulation: (a) Standard for Completing Greenhouse Gas Compliance and Forecasting Reports; (b) Standard for Developing Benchmarks; (c) Standard for Greenhouse Gas Emission Offset Project Developers; (d) Standard for Validation, Verification and Audit. If a facility, other than an opted-in facility or an aggregate facility, begins to have direct emissions of 100 000 CO2e tonnes or more in 2019 or a subsequent year, this Regulation does not apply to the facility until the year after the year in which the facility begins to have direct emissions of 100 000 CO2e tonnes or more.

Hunting is a set of activities or individual activities when, using hunting firearms, gear or techniques, game animals are tracked or searched for, caught, captured, injured or killed. Similar to hunting: (a) killing game animals kept in a fenced area in conditions similar to wild animals, using hunting firearms and hunting tools; the killing of game animals kept in conditions similar to wild animals in a fenced area is subject only to the safety requirements set forth in the laws and regulations governing hunting; (b) killing escaped captive-bred animals in hunting areas (upon a written request of the animal owner to the user of the hunting right) using hunting firearms and hunting gear; and (c) killing of stray domestic (room) animals in hunting grounds, using hunting firearms and in compliance with international agreements regulating animal protection and other regulatory acts. Hunting is prohibited: (a) in cemeteries; (b) in places where there is no registered hunting station, except for: hunting of unlimited game animals, in which the holder of hunting rights or a person authorized by him in writing participates; hunting of unlimited game animals in public waterbodies and in their tow lane; tracking of an injured game animal in accordance with the procedures specified in the regulatory acts; and (c) in cases specified in other regulatory acts. The Cabinet of Ministers shall determine the species of game animals, hunting deadlines, as well as cases when hunting outside the hunting deadlines is possible. Hunting deadlines for game birds are not determined during their breeding period or at any other stage important for the development of the species. The Cabinet of Ministers determines the procedure by which the State Forestry Service is entitled to change the hunting terms for mammals, as well as to determine additional restrictions or reliefs for the organization of hunting according to the state of the relevant animal population, damage caused by animals, meteorological conditions and phenological situation. Game animals living in the wild become the property of natural and legal persons only after they have been hunted in accordance with the procedures specified in this Law and other laws and regulations governing hunting. Game animals kept in a fenced area under conditions similar to wild game, as well as game animals born in a fenced area, are the property of the natural or legal person who has received a permit for keeping wild game animals in captivity in the specific area in accordance with the procedures specified in the laws and regulations. The hunting season is the period from April 1 to March 31 of the following year. A hunter's license is a document that is required to obtain a hunting permit, a hunter's season card and a permit to purchase a hunting firearm, as well as to be allowed to hunt in accordance with the procedures set forth in this law and other laws and regulations governing hunting. Hunters who have a hunting firearm possession permit issued by the State Police may hunt with hunting firearms. The State Forestry Service issues a hunter's or hunting manager's license to persons who have passed the relevant exam at the hunters' examination commission.

In Liberia, because of low level of adaptive capacity in different sectors, emanated from low level of human and institutional capacity, technology, infrastructure, economy, etc., the impact exerted by climate change is severe. The impacted sectors identified as priority sectors through stakeholders’ consultation and document review are: economic sectors such as forestry and wildlife, agriculture, coastal area, water, fishery, energy, mining, industry, transport and tourism, infrastructure, urbanization; and social sectors including health and settlement. The Policy and Response Strategy has recognized these sectors as priority sectors for adaptation. The policy statements for adaptation to climate change are hereunder in the summary, while their corresponding strategy elements can be referred in section 8.1 in the main body of the policy and strategy document. The Climate Change Policy and Response Strategy seeks: to strengthen coordination for the implementation of the national policy between the government and all stakeholders; to create an overarching framework for the integration of climate considerations and to support the implementation of Liberia’s national development strategy as well as other regional and international policies and frameworks; to enhance pro-poor and gender sensitive adaptation while also promoting mitigation at the national and local levels, to the extent possible in a cost-effective manner amidst the challenges and constraints posed by climate change; to provide guidance to the efforts of government in ensuring that the country achieves benefits from clean and renewable energy, energy efficiency and mitigation technologies that enhances the livelihoods of the people and promotes the national economy, while contributing to the global efforts to reduce GHG emissions and global warming; to ensure that development at the national and local levels are environmentally sustainable; to promote awareness on climate change and its impact on the country and to enhance the skill and institutional capacity of relevant stakeholders; and to promote the conservation of the nation’s rich biodiversity and natural resources so that they benefit the present and future generations.']"
