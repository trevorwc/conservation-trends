# Understanding Trends in Conservation Science, Action, and Policy

## Data Collection
We have extracted all journal articles with the keyword "conservation" published since 2013. This was done through Crossref's API, which allows for filtering of results based on criteria such as keywords and publication date. We kept only entries that included an abstract and the year it was published online. 

## Natural Language Processing
We will be applying the BerTopic model to analyze topics across year in paper abstracts.
